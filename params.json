With Shiro’s\r\n     easy-to-understand API, you can quickly and easily secure any application – from\r\n     the smallest mobile applications to the largest web and enterprise applications.\"\r\n\r\nFor now only x509 related extensions are available.\r\n\r\n\r\nX509\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis extension is splitted in two jars :\r\n\r\n- shiro-ext-x509-core that depends on [slf4j-api](http://www.slf4j.org/), [bouncycastle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/) provider and shiro-c\r\nore,\r\n- shiro-ext-x509-web that depends on shiro-ext-x509-core and shiro-web.\r\n\r\nYou certainly want to depend on the -web artifact. The project is hosted in maven central.\r\n[here](http://mavencentral.sonatype.com/#search|ga|1|shiro-ext-x509-web) you'll find a quick copy/paste for the dependency.\r\n\r\nBe sure to read about X509 certificates before choosing an authentication strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CredentialsMatchers\r\n\r\nThe following credential matchers are provided:\r\n\r\n- X509CredentialsPKIXPathMatcher\r\n\r\n    Custom PKIX path validation based on granted trust anchors provided by your Realm. Works for direct X509 authentication and with forwarded X509 authentication only if the full client certificate is available.\r\n\r\n- X509CredentialsSha256Matcher\r\n\r\n    Compute the Sha256 hashes of the client certificate and the one provided by your Realm and compare them. Works for direct X509 authentication and with forwarded X509 authentication only if the full client certificate is available.\r\n\r\n- X509CredentialsIssuerDNSNMatcher\r\n\r\n    Compare issuer distinguished name and serial number of the client certificate against info provided by your Realm. Works in both X509 authentication modes, usefull if your Realm can not access the full certificate.\r\n\r\n- X509CredentialsSujbectDNMatcher\r\n\r\n    Compare subject distinguished name of the client certificate against info provided by your Realm. Works in both X509 authentication modes, usefull if your Realm can not access the full certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your X509 Realm\r\n\r\nYou will need to implement a Realm extending AbstractX509Realm and use it in your Shiro configuration:\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    x509Realm = com.acme.YourRealm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Client X509Certificate authentication\r\n\r\nUse the following filter in your Shiro configuration:\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    x509 = org.codeartisans.shiro.x509.web.filter.authc.X509AuthenticationFilter\r\n\r\n    [urls]\r\n    /protected = x509\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Forwarded X509 authentication\r\n\r\nYou need this if your application is deployed in a container siting behind a reverse proxy and hence the ssl handshake is done by the reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nFor now the HTTP headers used to read forwarded SSL data from reverse proxies use the following names:\r\n\r\n- X-SSL-Client-Cert\r\n- X-SSL-Client-S-DN\r\n- X-SSL-Client-I-DN\r\n- X-SSL-Client-M-Serial\r\n\r\nIf you need configuration support for the header names, please fill an issue.\r\n\r\nBy default the filter read __no__ headers and hence simply refuse any authentication attempt.\r\nYou need to choose which headers to use in order to build the X509AuthenticationToken that will be used by the CredentialMatcher of your choice.\r\n\r\nHere are three Shiro configuration snippets for the different CredentialMatchers:\r\n\r\nFor X509CredentialsPKIXPathMatcher or X509CredentialsSha256Matcher:\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    x509 = org.codeartisans.shiro.x509.web.filter.authc.ForwardedX509AuthenticationFilter\r\n    x509.useCertificate = true\r\n\r\n    [urls]\r\n    /protected = x509\r\n\r\n\r\nFor X509CredentialsIssuerDNSNMatcher:\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    x509 = org.codeartisans.shiro.x509.web.filter.authc.ForwardedX509AuthenticationFilter\r\n    x509.useIssuerDN = true\r\n    x509.useSerialNumber = true\r\n\r\n    [urls]\r\n    /protected = x509\r\n\r\n\r\nFor X509CredentialsSujbectDNMatcher:\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    x509 = org.codeartisans.shiro.x509.web.filter.authc.ForwardedX509AuthenticationFilter\r\n    x509.useSubjectDN = true\r\n\r\n    [urls]\r\n    /protected = x509\r\n\r\n"}
